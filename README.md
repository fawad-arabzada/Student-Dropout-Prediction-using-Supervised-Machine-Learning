# Student-Dropout-Prediction-using-Supervised-Machine-Learning
This project analyzes a student dataset to predict the likelihood of university dropout using supervised machine learning techniques. The aim is to help educational institutions identify at-risk students early and take proactive measures to improve retention rates.
The workflow includes:
Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding, scaling, feature engineering)
Binary classification of the target (Dropout vs Not Dropout)
Visualization of key patterns and distributions
Training and evaluation of four ML models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and SVM
Model comparison using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC
Feature importance analysis to understand key dropout indicators
ðŸ“Š Best Result: Achieved ~89% accuracy using Random Forest Classifier.
ðŸ”§ Tools used: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
